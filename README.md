# AI Football Assistant  
### Phase 1: Player Scouting | Phase 2: Team Tactics

This project is an AI-based football analytics system developed for PBL-2.  
It is designed to help small football clubs identify promising players and analyze team performance using data-driven methods.

The system combines machine learning, basic deep learning, feature engineering, and a Tkinter-based GUI.
